## Threads in CSharp
Make a C # coded program, using csc.exe and methods for
C # thread management. 
The program must be Multithread and creates two additional threads to the
main program that receives an integer value n as a parameter on the command line. 
- One thread receives n as parameter, prints and calculates the factorial value of n. 

-The other thread also receives n as a parameter, prints and calculates the value of the nth term of the fibonnacci sequence. 
- O main program computes and prints the sum of the values calculated by the threads
