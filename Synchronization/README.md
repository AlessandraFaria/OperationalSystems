# Synchronization

## Monitor
Using monitors and implementing, using csc.exe, the producer program and
consumer in C #. The buffer must store characters, which are extracted by the
numbers and the full names of the students in the group, which are passed as
parameter. The production and consumption cycle should be interrupted by the main
press the T key on the command line.

## Traffic lights
Using semaphores and implementing, using csc.exe, the producer program and
consumer in C #. The buffer must store characters, which are extracted by the
numbers and the full names of the students in the group, which are passed as
parameter. The production and consumption cycle should be interrupted by the main
press the T key on the command line.

## Dijkstra Philosophers' Dinner & Sleeping Barber

Implement two (2) programs in C # to solve the problems listed below;
- The classic philosophers' dinner Dijsktra problem (with at least 5 philosophers). Note:
Exercise 9 of Chapter 7 of Operating Systems, DEITEL, H.M., 3a. ed. (2005)
(ref SOPI: Tanenbaum / Bookman pg 64, SOC-SGG / Campus pg 139 (Java) and SOM-TB 3a ed. pg 98 to 100).

- The classic Barber problem asleep (sleepy). Ref. Exercise 10 of Chapter 6
of the book Operating Systems, DEITEL, H.M., 3a. ed. (2005) SOM-TB 2. ed. 92-97).

These programs must meet the following specifications:
- Must use threads to simulate the competition
- They must be free of deadlocks and for such a program must use traffic lights and
the other must use monitors.
